<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 This pattern should be used to make it easy for a user to select the appropriate credential and to inform him which data will the recipient have after the transmission.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

For a recipient to be able to trust a user with certain resources, that user will have to submit one or more appropriate credentials.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

A user has to proof something to the recipient by submitting one or more credentials. However, different credentials may have different levels of privacy-sensitivity to different users, and a user must be made fully aware of the information they convey by submitting a credential and who exactly the recipient is.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Let users select exactly which credential they share, and give them full information about what data the recipient will have after transmission.

##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

Allows a user to be very specific in which way they identify themselves, and how much information they reveal by doing so.
