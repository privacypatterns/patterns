##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Permission to Use Sensitive Data via Privacy Agreement - Explicit Consent

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

The organization that wants to process sensitive data and the agent holding that data both sign a timestamped agreement containing the privacy policy applying to this data transfer.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Agents: Agent 1, Organization H. Resources:  Organization’s Privacy Policy, Sensitive data: 1/ Sensitive data1, 2/ Sensitive data2 and 3/ Sensitive data3

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

If Organization H wants to deliver medical services to Agent1 it needs an explicit permission to use the Sensitive data related Information from Agent1.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Once the Organization H and Agent1 agree on the privacy practices described in Privacy Policy they both need to sign it. Signing it serves as means of explicit consent. Furthermore the agreement is time stamped to assure the point in time in which it starts to be valid. As such Privacy Agreement is composed of: • Agreed Privacy Policy • Signatures of both parties involved • Timestamp Each of the parties involved gets a copy of signed agreement. In this manner repudiation of agreement is not possible. 2 exact copies of Privacy Agreement are introduced one belonging to Agent1 and the other to Organization H. Each of them is composed of: • Agreed Privacy Policy • Signatures of both parties involved • Timestamp
