##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Separate Master Data from Transactional Data

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Separating data according to usage limits misuse opportunities

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Where personal data is stored and otherwise processed impacts how easily it can be misused and correlated with other data to undermine privacy

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Storing and processing personal data together as one related data set can make usage and analysis more efficient or effective, but doing so risks identifiablity of the personal data because it gives uncecessary scope which allows more data to be compromised 

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Keep different types of personal data apart from one another, both logically and physically, so that correlation is more difficult
