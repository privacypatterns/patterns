##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Discouraging blanket strategies

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Do not offer only full public and full private options, have other settings between those levels as well.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Extremes in media sharing or hiding policies

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

All or nothing strategies encourage over or under sharing

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Introduce a range of privacy settings instead of an all or nothing strategy

<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

Grants users complete control over the privacy of their own data, which may lower the bar for them to share certain data they otherwise wouldn't. However, the data system itself will become more complicated as it needs to ensure the privacy protection of every user individually as it was set by them, and it becomes more prone to errors that share more data than the user had set in their preferences. The privacy controls themselves also need to be designed in such a way that it is very clear to users what each setting does and what it means for their privacy.
