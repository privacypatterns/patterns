##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Task-based Processing

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Separating data processing according to specific tasks limits misuse opportunities

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

When personal data is processed impacts how easily it can be misused and correlated with other data to undermine privacy

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Processing personal data in bulk is easier, but carries with it greater risks of identifiablity as tasks which should not have access to data may be compromised 

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Keep different personal data defined for one purpose apart from the rest, so that correlation is more difficult, and so that no data is used for illegitimate purposes
