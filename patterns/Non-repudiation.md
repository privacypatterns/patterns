##Name

Non-repudiation

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

The Employer requests the achievement of a commitment and delegates its execution to the Executor, but the former has no warranties that the latter takes the responsibility of achieving the commitment

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

An organization [delegates] subtasks that are...considered critical for the organization, a simple statement [does not] release [responsibilities]. In such cases, the employer might want a non-repudiable acknowledgment from the executor to have proof that the latter has explicitly taken the responsibility of executing the task'. 'The Employer shall [need] evidence that the Executor cannot repudiate his commitment

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

The Employer refines the commitment into two sub parts. The first part is used to check the evidence about responsibilities taken by the Executor and the second represents the actual desire of fulfilling the commitment. To achieve the commitment, the Employer delegates the execution of the commitment to the Executor together with a request for a proof of commitment. Once received, this proof ensures the Employer that the Executor has taken the responsibility of the commitment. This establishes a trust relationship between them. In case the Executor fails to achieve the commitment, the Employer can rely on the proof of commitment
