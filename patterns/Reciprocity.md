##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Reciprocity

###[Also Known As]
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->

Fair distribution of efforts / Win-win situation

<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Your system uses the user’s input to produce the group result. To facilitate collaboration, ideally all group members participate in the group process to reach a goal.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

It is easy to agree on participation, if the goal is beneficious for everyone. But in many work situations, some people benefit more than others from a reached goal. In the extreme case, the beneficiaries of the reached goal do not have to participate in the group efforts at all. This leads to a situ- ation, where the people who have to spend efforts on the group result no longer see the need to participate since the results are not valuable for them.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Establish reciprocity. Ensure that all group members’ activities result in an improved group result that is beneficial for all group members again. Prohibit people to benefit from group results if they are not willing to help the group in return.

<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

The pattern is only needed in situations, where the critical mass of participation can only be reached with most users participating. If the community is very large (e.g. a news group), it can succeed with a small number of active participants and a larger number of inactive participants (free riders, lurkers).

<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->



##Examples
<!--Motivational example to see how the pattern is applied.-->
