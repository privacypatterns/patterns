##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Constant Length Padding

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Suggests making the size of data packets the same in a mix network.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

In a mix network, incoming packets may be modified to each have the same length when dispatched to prevent association

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

A mix network uses Layered Encryption to protect packet headers and data. However, meta-information about packet content can be leaked from packet size. [An] adversary [should] be [unable] to exploit the size variation in data traffic

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Make the length of all packets the same. If needed, add padding to data packets. Mixmaster, Mixminion, Babel and Tarzan [break] data into uniform-sized packets, and [pad] the packets to a uniform size. In practice, cyphertext is usually somewhat longer than cleartext. Chaum suggests breaking data into fixed size blocks and pad them.
