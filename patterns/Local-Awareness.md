##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Local Awareness

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Although most systems that work on shared data provide support for coordinating shared access, they often don’t tell the user, who is working on a specific artifact. Such information is needed to establish ad-hoc teams that share a common focus. Without such information, users assume to work alone – and do not see the possibility or urge for collaboration.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Provide awareness in context. This means that the system tells the local user, who else is currently interested in the local user’s focussed artifact and what they do with this artifact.
