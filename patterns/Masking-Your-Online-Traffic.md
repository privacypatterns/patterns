##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Communicating across a public and untrusted network can have negative consequences if you have a false expectation of privacy and your messages are intercepted. This pattern provides solutions to help users protect their privacy while by reducing the amount of information that they disclose while interacting online.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

[A user wants] to interact online but [doesn't] want to reveal more information about [themself] than is necessary. [The user is] aware of various technologies and protocols that claim to protect [their] privacy, but [is] uncertain how and when to use them.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

[The user is] looking for ways to reduce the amount of personal information that [they] disclose, but [must] eventually disclose some information in order to transact with the other party. [They want to avoid: snooping, detection, expertise requirements, and difficulty]

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Employ personal behaviors and technologies that mask or prevent identifiable information from being disclosed. This will limit the amount of information that can be collected and used without [consent. These include: Using pseudonyms or anonymising systems, blocking or individually selecting cookies, and personal habits such as physical consideration for privacy and the use of abstracted data where possible] .
