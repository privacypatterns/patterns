##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 The goal of this display is to provide the user information about why what information by whom is requested. It should be used whenever personal data are required from the user.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

The user is requested to enter (additional) information about themselves.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Whenever the user's information is requested, it must be clear to them exactly what information is needed, who requests it, and what will be done with it.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Every time when (additional) personal information is requested, clearly state what information is needed by whom and for which purpose.

<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

By constantly reminding a user what it means to share their information and where it will end up, the user will hopefully think more about what information to share when and with whom. However, users may get annoyed by the constant reminders and start to tune out privacy policies, which means they may not notice it when a policy is suddenly very different from previous ones.
