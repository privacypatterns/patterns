Minimal Information Asymmetry

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

This pattern describes how you can protect your privacy by gathering more information about the parties with whom you would like to transact online. By gathering more information, you are able to make more informed decisions and transact only with the parties you trust

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

An online consumer [wants] to interact with websites that sell products or services, register for their online services such as electronic banking, health insurance, or subscribe to local news and events. However, [the user is] often disadvantaged by having less information about the products or services, or conditions of the agreement than does the website.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Information asymmetry is generally described as one party having more or better information about a transaction than the other. Unfortunately, in this context, the website generally has the better information. The problem is: How can you shift the balance of information in order to make a better decision when transacting online?

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Your privacy could be protected by reducing the amount of information that you transmit to others [and] by increasing the amount of information you collect. Organizations that properly implement the informed consent model provide you with more information about how your information will be collected and used. They may also provide you with the ability to opt-out (or opt-in) of their business services. Where possible, recognize signals that shift the balance of information in your favor. The signal must be relevant [and] credible. [Look for]: Feedback[,] Reputation[,] Warranties[,] Money-back guarentees[, and] Privacy Policies.
