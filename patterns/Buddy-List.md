##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Buddy List

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

You are using an interaction space like a communication channel, a groupware application or a collaborative virtual environment to- gether with many other users.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When many users are able to interact in the interaction space, it is hard to maintain an overview of relevant in- teraction partners since the number of users exceeds the number of relevant contacts for a specific user. User lists grow very large and it is hard to find people who the local user knows. On the other hand, the local user is in often only inter- ested in those people who he knows.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Provide buddy lists, where a user can enter other users who are of interest to him. Whenever the local user browses other users, first show only users from the buddy list.

<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

If users only consider buddy lists for maintaining contacts to other users, they will hardly find new users in the system. Thus you should ensure that users can also browse other users who are not on their buddy list (e.g. by providing a User Gallery).

<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->



##Examples
