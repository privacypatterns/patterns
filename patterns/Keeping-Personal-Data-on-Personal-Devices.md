##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Keeping Personal Data on Personal Devices

###[Also Known As]
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->

Personal Data Store / Data Confinement

##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Subjects keep control on their personal data that are stored on a personal device.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

The pattern is applicable to any data produced by the data subject (or originally under his control) as opposed to data about him produced by third parties.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Data subjects lose control over their data when they are stored on a server operated by a third party.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

A solution consists in combining a central server and secure personal tokens. Personal tokens, which can take the form of USB keys, embed a database system, a local web server and a certificate for their authentication by the central server. Data subjects can decide on the status of their data and, depending on their level of sensitivity, choose to record them exclusively on their personal token or to have them replicated on the central server. Replication on the central server is useful to enhance sustainability and to allow designated third parties (e.g. health professionals) to get access to the data.
