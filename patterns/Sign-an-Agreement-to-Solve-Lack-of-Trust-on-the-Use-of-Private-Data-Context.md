##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Agents of organizations have clients sign contracts that contain the organization's privacy policy to ensure that the client trusts the organization and the agent with processing their personal data.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

The roles are “Organization A”, “Agent A” and “Client” ? The resources are “Client’s privacy data”, “Organization A’s privacy policy”

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

The client does not trust “Organization A” to use his personal data, so the “Agent A” does not have permission to access client’s data.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

The “Agent A” on behalf of “Organisation A” asks the “client “ to read and sign an agreement containing the ”organization A’s privacy policy” where it is states that the “Organization A” guarantees the privacy of the client.So, the solution consists mainly in:Introducing a new task for the “Agent A”, “Acquaint client with “Organization A’s privacy policy”.
