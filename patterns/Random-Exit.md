<!--###[Also Known As]-->

##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Suggests adding a variation to packet routing mechanism by allowing mix networks to forward packet to a recipient instead of forwarding to the next hop.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

In a mix network, incoming packets may be routed out prematurely to prevent association if there are compromised exit nodes

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

The exit node of an anonymity network forwards a packet to its final recipient. Exit nodes often come under abuse. Having a few exit nodes reduces the number of points an adversary needs to monitor.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Allow traffic to exit an anonymity network not only at the endpoints [of] a circuit, but also in the middle of a circuit. Tor initiators can direct traffic to exit partway down the circuit, by using in-band signaling within the circuit. This frustrates traffic shape and volume attacks based on observing the end of the circuit.
