Creating Privacy Policy

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Deals with creation and articulation of Privacy Policies from selecting types of personally identifiable information that will be gathered and processed to defining purposes for processing and obligations.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Privacy policies are required for any service that processes personal data.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Data law requires that data subjects give their informed consent before their personal data may be processed for the specified purpose. For this the data subject must be thoroughly informed how their data will be protected and what purpose it is being processed for.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Create a privacy policy that data subjects may read to inform themselves before they give their consent. This privacy policy will state exactly which information is collected and for what purpose it will be processed.

##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

European data law requires informed concent and purpose specification. A privacy policy is instrumental in informing data subjects and specifying the purpose of data processing. A company that does not properly inform its data subjects risks violating data laws.

<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->
