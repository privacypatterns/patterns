##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Preventing mistakes or reducing their impact

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Prevent accidental automatic disclosure of personal information.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Automatic media sharing implementations

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Immediate automatic publication without notification or confirmation of consent leads to unintentional sharing

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Use contextual measures to predict whether media should be uploaded, and obtain consent for publication to prevent accidental sharing

<!--###[Structure]-->

##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

Cleaning up data that was shared mistakenly adds additional overhead, especially if the service does not offer a quick and easy way for users to modify/remove anything they've added. In addition, it may result in a lot of embarassment and potential damage for a client if they share something they didn't want to share, so they will definitely benefit from systems that reduce the risks and impact of mistakes.
