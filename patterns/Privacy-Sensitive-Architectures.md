##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Privacy-Sensitive Architectures

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Just as the architecture of a building can influence how it is perceived and used, the architecture of a ubiquitous computing system can influence how people’s perceptions of privacy, and consequently, how they use the system.

<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Data subjects are often provided with privacy unfriendly systems which do not provide the necessary controls or information for them to adequately control the processing of their data

<!--##Solution-->
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->



<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



<!--##Consequences-->
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->



<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->
