<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Curtains provide a simple form of control for maintaining one’s privacy while at home. Allowing users to participate anonymously in functionality which does not affect others provides a similar freedom from scrutiny.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

In most online contexts, certain functionality (such as browsing a catalogue) does not (need to) effect other users, and should not create negative impact if it can be performed anonymously. This goes beyond mere 'invisible mode', as the user should not need to register to achieve minimal functionality. 

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Users are tracked online by default, as they move around the web their presence and activity on websites is stored, either in cookies or on the server side of not only the sites they visited, but any embedded sites such as from advertising companies. 

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

While users can turn off cookies, and use anonymising technologies, an effort can be made from the provider's side to allow users to use certain services without their usage or presence being tracked.

###[Structure]
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->

Determine what services are available to users without any need for identification or tracking, and without the lack of these impacting others negatively. If such services, which could usually include a landing page, do exist, then allow users to access these services without allowing component elements to track them.
