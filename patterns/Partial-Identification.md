##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Partial Identification

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Rather than requiring precise identity, systems could just know that there is “a person” or “a person that has used this system before.”

<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When a data subject is authenticated they are typically directly associated with a user ID or similar value which correlates to their identify and thus makes them identifiable

<!--##Solution-->
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->



<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



<!--##Consequences-->
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->



<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->



<!--##Examples-->
<!--Motivational example to see how the pattern is applied.-->
