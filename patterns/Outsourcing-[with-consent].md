Outsourcing [with consent]

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

The Data Controller outsources the execution of data processing to an outside Supplier for which Data Subject’s personal data are needed. However, the Data Subject has signed a contract according to which only the Data Controller and assigned members of its organization are entitled to process his data'

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Outsourcing 'has a strong impact on the security and privacy requirements of organizations'. 'The Supplier shall [need] the permission necessary to achieve outsourced data processing.'

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Before the Data Controller can outsource the data processing to the Supplier, he has to obtain the consent of the Data Subject. The consent can be seen as a contract establishing what and how data will be processed by the Supplier. The Data Controller must also ensure, preferably by a written agreement, that the Supplier strictly follows all conditions relating to data processing that were imposed on him.'
