##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 This pattern provides unlinkability between senders and receivers by encapsulating the data in different layers of encryption, limiting the knowledge of each node along the delivery path.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

A system in which data is routed between different nodes.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When delivering data, the receiver has to be known. If the system provides the functionality that the receiver of data should be able to answer, than the receiver should also know the address of the sender. When forwarding information over multiple stations then, in a naive implementation, each station on the delivery path knows the sender and the final destination.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

The solution is to encrypt the data in layers such that every station on the way can remove one layer of encryption and thus get to know the immediate next station. This way, every party on the path from the sender to the receiver only gets to know the immediate successor and predecessor on the delivery path.
