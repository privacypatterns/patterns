##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Physical Privacy Zones

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

People need places where they feel that they are free from being monitored.

<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When an inidividual is constantly subjected to monitoring and logging of their activities, they need to continuously endure subjugation and public scrutiny, which is potentially exhausting and detrimental to their mental wellbeing. This infringes on their right to privacy

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

People need a physical location where they can recover from the pressures of surveillance and become free to reflect and experience life without being judged for their private behaviours
