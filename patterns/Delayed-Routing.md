##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Delayed Routing

###[Also Known As]
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->

Random Wait

##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Random Wait suggests adding delays to incoming data traffic of a mix to thwart timing attacks.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

In a mix network, incoming packets may be dispatched at dissociated times to prevent association

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Systems with variable number of users and with changing traffic conditions may result in low levels of anonymity. An attacker can also take advantage by launching a denial of service attack on the incoming channel of a mix, and force it to drop its stale traffic. [A] node [should] be implemented to operate without depending on external sources to create anonymity cover.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Add random delays to make a system non-deterministic. Keep a packet in the pool, and forward it immediately after the delay is passed. The delay is typically generated by the message sender, who adds it to message header. The random delay can be assigned from a memoryless exponential distribution, or from a uniform distribution.
