##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Building Trust and Credibility

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Trust and credibility are the foundation for an ongoing relationship.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Any type of organization with a privacy policy.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Even when a potential data subject has access to a privacy policy, they may not believe that the organisation is prepared to uphold it. In order to obtain consent from these data subjects, the organisation needs to demonstrate that it can be trusted

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

By following recommended best practices and standards, as well as building positive experience history, properly enforcing and demonstrating desirable policies on data protection and privacy, an organisation can build a credible name for itself with respect to personal data
