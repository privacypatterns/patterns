Informed Consent

##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 This pattern describes how websites can inform users whenever they intend to collect and use an individual’s personal information.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Web developers and website interaction designers are creating a website that will collect personal information from users for a survey, registration, or other purpose.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

To facilitate transactions, websites often use cookies to track users and web forms to collect personal information. However, users are often resistant to disclosing personal information because they are uncertain if it will be used without their consent or against their interests. The problem is: How can website designers communicate their intended uses for the information they collect from users?

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

To the extent possible given the limits imposed by web technology, provide the user with the six elements of informed consent: Disclosure [of purpose specification and limitation,] Agreement [and disagreement capabilities,] Comprehension [through easily understandable, comprehensive and concise explanations,] Voluntariness [showing that consent is freely-given,] Competence [to make reasonable legally binding decisions, and] Minimal Distraction [which may otherwise aggrevate the user].
