##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Enforce the collecting and processing of data in a predefined confinement area (which could be a user controlled location, or an engineer defined distributed location). The rationale for the enforcement principle is to prevent accidental or malicious leaking of personal data.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Implementation of a data management capability should follow the principles for data protection (purpose specification, consent, limited collection-use-disclosure-retention, accuracy, safety, openness, and compliance)

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

For instance careless management of a web server that collects customer data would increase the risk that employees access such data without authorisation.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

The resulting architecture associates data with metadata describing protection policies, e.g. who can have access to data, or retention parameters. Data can only be accessed through a well-defined interface (e.g. based on a query language). Finally the data management takes proactive moves for enforcing policies (e.g. data is deleted after the retention limit).
