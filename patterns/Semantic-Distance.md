##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Semantic Distance

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Your Semantic Net is very dense in a sense that artifacts have a semantic relation to many other artifacts. But not all artifacts have the same importance for the user. If the user sees only the semantic net, he might get lost in the diversity of relations.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Use weighted edges to describe the strength of the semantic relation. Interpret these edges as distances.

<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



<!--##Consequences-->
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->



<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->



<!--##Examples-->
<!--Motivational example to see how the pattern is applied.-->



<!--###[Known Uses]-->
<!-- Pointers to various applications of the pattern.-->
