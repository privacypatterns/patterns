##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Appropriate Privacy Feedback

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Supplies the user with privacy feedback, more precisely with feedback about what is monitored and accessed by whom

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Can be applied to any system where users are required to enter personal data.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When data subjects are unsure about what personal data is collected and then processed about them, they may choose to take the risk in order to acquire services, never finding out how their data may be misused

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Appropriate feedback loops are needed to help ensure people understand what data is being collected and who can see that data.
