##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Increasing awareness of information aggregation

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Inform users about the danger of information aggregation.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Poor awareness of automatic media metadata aggregation

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

A lack of user awareness of aggregated data privacy concerns can lead to them unintentionally revealing private trend information

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Notify and inform users of the dangers of data aggregation through example, to prevent them from over sharing

<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

If users understand the power of data aggregation better, they are better able to put any new data they're about to share in perspective to all the data they've already shared, and may consider the total picture this creates of them more carefully. But this also means that it becomes harder for organizations to create accurate profiles of people and may result in improper labelling based on the little data that is known.
