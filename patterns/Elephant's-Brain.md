##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Elephant's Brain

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Merging two user’s (past or current) work is a difficult task. It requires that the activities are transferred to the same context and that the goals are aligned. But many applications don’t provide access to the artifact’s history, its use, and its evolution. Thus, merging is vulnerable to errors and often collaboration does not take place since the merging efforts exceeds the estimated gains of a collaboration.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Remember all activities that users perform on shared artifacts – not only modifying accesses, but also read accesses.
