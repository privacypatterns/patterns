##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

K-anonymity

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Make unique identification of people in an anonymized dataset impossible by having potentially identifying attribute combinations always link to at least k entries.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Data sets that have been anonymized before being transferred to another organization, or sold on the commercial market.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Even when data has been anonymized, people can often be uniquely identified through inference of the data that remains in the data set with other (anonymized) datasets.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

If RT is a dataset and QI_RT is a quasi-identifier (a set of attributes in RT that could potentially identify an individual in RT), then if a certain combination of values for the attributes in QI_RT exists in RT, that combination of values must occur in at least k entries. Only if an anonymized dataset satisfies this property may it be released.

##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

The primary problem of k-anonymity is determining quasi-identifiers, those combinations of attributes that could potentially identify individuals. Predicting every possible inference attack with a dataset is virtually impossible, as it may always be possible to identify individuals by inferring the dataset with another dataset in a way that was not predicted. If quasi-identifiers are correctly picked, k-anonymity does protect against direct matching, and at least prevents anonymity violation by inference attacks of that kind.
