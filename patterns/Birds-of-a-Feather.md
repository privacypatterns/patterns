##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

###[Also Known As]
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->

Expertise Selection

<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Users interact with artifacts in a shared information space. The artifacts refer to specific topics.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

If people don’t know one another, it is hard to decide who could be a good partner for a collaborative activity. For co-located situations, humans have developed intuitive strategies (based e.g. on visual clues) that help them to select, whom they should contact if group formation is needed. In distributed work environments, the presence of other users is often reduced to their user name. This makes it hard to find another user for a collabo- rative activity.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Compare user profiles or interaction histories to identify two users who share big parts of their history. Propose these users as collaboration partners.

<!--###[Structure]-->
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->



<!--###[Implementation]-->
<!--Guidelines for implementing the pattern; code fragments; suggested PETS; policy fragments.-->



##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

Recommendation systems in general have the tendency to affect the local user’s attitudes. As Cosley, Lam, Albert, Konstan, and Riedl (2003) found out, users rate recommended items differently if they knew the recommendation in advance. This may also have an effect in systems that recommend collaboration partners although there has not yet been any investigation of this hypothesis.

<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->
