##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Hide the meta information associated with data content that reveal information about sensitive data content

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

You are designing a system to protect the privacy of the users. This system will maintain sender anonymity in a messaging scenario. Although this is an important application area, the context is not limited to messaging only. The context also entails other scenarios like anonymity in a location tracking systemor anonymity preserv- ing data sharing in a data publishing system.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Any metadata associated with the data traffic in the network reveals information about the originator of that data packet. The packet headers are used for information routing in forward and reverse direction. The information in the packet headers like IP addresses reveal private information about sender’s identity and their location.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Obfuscate the metadata associated with the data. For the web browsing domain, create a middleman between the request sender and the recipient that strips off identity-revealing metadata from the packet headers. For email messaging, use a remailer that strips identifying header information from outbound email messages. Strip off the pseudonym associated with an agent when he enters the mix zone. Assign a different pseudonym to the agent when he comes out of the mix zone. For privacy preserving data sharing, scramble the sorting order of the data in the table. Remove any other meta-information in the data that can compromise the privacy.
