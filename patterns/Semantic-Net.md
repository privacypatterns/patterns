##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Semantic Net

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



<!--##Summary-->
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->



<!--##Context-->
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->



##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Detecting short semantic distances between artifacts based on a similarity measureoften leads to ineffective and inexact results.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Produce a semantic net that contains artifacts and relations between artifacts. Relate two artifacts, if they have much in common (as in the Semantic Distance pattern). Define the distance between two artifacts as the length of the shortest path between these artifacts.

<!--###[Structure]-->
