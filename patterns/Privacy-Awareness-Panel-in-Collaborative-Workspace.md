##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

Privacy Awareness Panel in Collaborative Workspace

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 The developed privacy panel shall users make aware of data (like IP or location) which are visible to others in a collaborative workspace. It should be used by collaborative workspace providers to help user protecting their privacy.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

To allow users to make better informed decision whetherthey want to disclose personal data in their contributions to collaborative workspaces.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

The problem with users’ awareness for privacy in collaborative workspaces, e.g., forums or wikis, is twofold. First, the users can contribute under self-chosen nicknames instead of using their real names, which leads to a higher perceived anonymity of the users. However, providers of collaborative workspaces have more information about a user’s real identity (e.g., IP address). Secondly, in collaborative workspaces, users disclose information – personal and non-personal – to an unknown audience. They have no idea how many and what kind of people can access their contributions. Both harm the person’s privacy, even if the person is unaware of this.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

In a so-called privacy-awareness panel, the audience is made transparent to the user, i.e., who can access his/her contribution (all internet users, registered users …). It is also pointed out that providers have additional information about the user. Hence, the privacy-awareness panel helps users to better understand their level of anonymity and private sphere within the collaborative workspace and based on this they can make better-informed decisions whether they want to disclose personal information in their contributions.

###[Structure]
<!--A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern. A class diagram if applicable.-->

First, it should be made clear to users which persons will be able to access their contributions. Second, users should know that providers get additional information about them for instance their IP addresses, browser versions, location nformation etc. and thus that they are not completely anonymous in the forum, wiki or other collaborative workspaces.

##Consequences
<!--The advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (liabilities) of applying the pattern.-->

Improved awareness of users about who exactly will be able to see the information they're about to share will hopefully make them consider more carefully what they share.

<!--###[Constraints]-->
<!-- limitations as a consequence of applying the pattern.-->
