##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

The fair information practices are a set of privacy guidelines for companies and organizations for managing the personal information of individuals. They have been contested as insufficient when compared to more comprehensive principles, like the OECD's privacy prinicples, and are not enforceable from a legal stand point.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

These guidelines are applicable as a base from which to build upon where legislative alternatives are not mandatory. It is suggested to adopt the OECD's variation on this as it includes individual participation and accountability.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

In response to a growing use of automated data processing systems during the 70's, the Federal Trade Commission and other advisory commitees in the US developed an initial set of guidelines. However, these were built upon over time, and now are reflected most usefully in the OECD guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

The FIP includes Notice/Awareness, Choice/Consent, Access/Participation, Integrity/Security, and Enforcement/Redress. The OECD variation includes Collection Limitation, Data Quality, Purpose Specification, Use Limitation, Security Safeguards, Openness, Individual Participation, and Accountability.

Apart from that which is implicit from the names of the principles:Collection Limitation - obtain data lawfully, fairly, with knowledge or consentData Quality - relevant to purpose, accurate, complete, up-to-datePurpose Specification - given prior to collection, either compatible or renewedUse Limitation - no use or access  other than consented to and or legalSecurity Safeguards - against any illegitimate use or accessOpenness - developments, practices, policies, state, purpose, contact detailsIndividual Participation - inquiries, modification, notification - easily and timelyAccountability - for compliance with measures above
