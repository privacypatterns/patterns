<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Data Controllers must inform all Agents about to enter an area where data is collected with a clear sign before they enter the area.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

Sensor Network Provider Agent1 Agent2 Sensor Network Data Controller Resources: Resource “Collected data” is delegated by Data Controller to Sensor Network provider which delegate it to Sensor Network

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Sensor Network collects Agent1’s information. In case of other people being present in the house equipped with sensor network, their information is being collected as a part of Agent1’s context as well. In case when the nature of data collected could be used to identify Agent2, Sensor network provider needs to take appropriate actions to inform Agent2 about the data collection performed by sensors.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Data Controller needs to unambiguously inform any party about gathering their personal information. People need to be informed when their personal data is being collected without their knowledge, as in this case. This can be achieved posting a sign explaining that by entering the house equipped with sensor network user agrees to be monitored by sensor network. Additionally the sign should inform the said party what data is gathered, and what purposes it is used for. This sigh [sic] should be posted at every possible entry to the house equipped with sensor network. Sign containing Privacy Policy information notice is introduced by Sensor Network Provider on behalf of Data Controller
