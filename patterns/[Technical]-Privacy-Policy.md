##Name
<!--Primary name the pattern is known by.-->

[Technical] Privacy Policy

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

While not as effective in the broader sense, privacy policies provide access to information on data practices and are encouraged by legislation. They allow both legal and self-regulation and analysis

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

In any organisation which handles personal data, data subjects need to be informed about how their data is handled, which is usually approached with a Privacy Policy

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

Subjects are not aware of an organisation's data practices inherently, and must be given easy access to this information in order to protect their rights

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Enabling power users or particularly interested users to learn about specific data practices. Facilitating self-regulation and expert watchdogs to uncover and document unsavory behaviors, providing a regulatory “hook”for enforcement through consumer protection laws, and encouraging organizations to go through a self-analysis of data-handling practices
