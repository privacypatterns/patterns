##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

This pattern hides the actions taken by a user by adding fake actions that are undistinguishable from real.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

This pattern is applicable when it is not possible to avoid executing, delaying or obfuscating the content of an action.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When users interact with ICT systems their actions reveal a lot of information about themselves. An option would be for users to not perform such actions to protect their privacy. However, this is not possible since users cannot completely avoid executing these actions because they need to perform them to achieve a goal (e.g., search for a word on the internet, send an email, search for a location).

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Since the action must be accurately performed, an option to provide privacy is to simultaneously perform other actions in such a way that the adversary cannot distinguish real and fake (often called dummy) actions.
