Privacy Aware Wording

<!--###[Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



##Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

 Users shall clearly understand the content and the terms of privacy policies. This approach should be used every time when a privacy policy will be displayed to a user.

##Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

A data processor must display its privacy policy to a user before that user can give informed consent to process their personal data.

##Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

A privacy policy is pointless if the user does not understand it. Privacy policies that are verbose and filled with technical terms are hard to read and understand, and users will have a stronger tendency to just click past them.

##Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Use clear and simple wording to explain exactly what each privacy policy encompasses as they are shown to the user.
